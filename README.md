# Detection-prediction-of-driver-cognitive-distraction

High cognitive workload is one of the leading contributing factors for traffic accidents. 

As such, in recent years, many experimental driver monitoring technologies have been presented, based on physiological sensors or driver-facing cameras. However, these systems have limited practical use; drivers cannot be expected to attach electrodes to themselves, while cameras are affected by lighting conditions, occlusions and are also expensive. 

Consequently, there is great need for non-intrusive, low-cost and robust driver monitoring systems, based on simple, reliable sensors, such as the Controller Area Network (CAN)-bus, which is already installed on all cars. 

In this project, the main objective is to develop Machine Learning models to detect/predict whether a driver is cognitively distracted, based on data from the CAN-bus of the car. A successful predictive model may have the chance of materializing into a system that can be deployed in actual vehicles.
